## Details and Accordion

The file and image fields, fieldset, details and accordion are all container elements to some degree, having a number of sub-elements in relation to one another. They all use a background tone and slightly darker border to contain these sub-elements and visually signal their grouping. They do this with as light a touch as possible while remaining distinguishable. To soften them slightly, a 2px border-radius is applied to the outer corners.

This is a style that would require more real-world prototyping, to see the impact on various forms.
