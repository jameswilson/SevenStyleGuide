## Page Navigation (Nav List)

<img src="http://groups.drupal.org/files/18.nav-list.png" alt"same as D7, with smaller icons" />

The Nav List is used on “hub” pages to provide an on-page navigation menu with help text. This component is not greatly changed from D7, with only minor typographic finessing and a rounding of the “fancy bullet” used to mark the list items, in keeping with the friendliness of the brand.
