## Basic Form Controls

<em>Customized controls for <code><select>, <input type="checkbox"> and <input type="radio"></code> (disabled state on the right)</em>

There are challenges associated with customizing these particular form controls, especially around accessibility. However, we feel there are a number of ascetic gains that can be made if we choose to implement this.

Similar to the text fields we use slightly rounded corners on these form elements to capture the softness we wish to express. We additionally styled the checkbox/radioâ€™s somewhat special to accommodate the idea of brand consistency across platforms.
